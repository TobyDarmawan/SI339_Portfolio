    <h1>Personal Knowledge Management (PKM)</h1>

    <p>PKMs are a way to manage your personal knowledge. In the digital age, the content we consume becomes overwhelming. Be it movies or video games, I often end up consuming more than I create. To remedy this, I try to create as I consume using a PKM. With every movie I watch, and every game I play, I make sure I note my thoughts on it.

    PKMs are useful because they allow your knowledge to compount in value over time. Here's how that works with Obsidian, the tool I use for my PKM. Obsidian is not only a note taking app like Notion, Evernote, etc. This is because it's really just a wrapper for editing markdown files in a folder. There are several advantages to this. Firstly, this makes your notes future-proof and portable to any other system. If you don't find Obsidian to work for you, there's no loss since it's just an editor of your local markdown files. This also means there isn't any proprietary file formats that would make migrating to another note-taking app difficult.

    The key advantage of Obsidian is that it treats each file as a node in a graph. This encourages both an emergent file structure and linking your thoughts.

    Emergent file structures

    Traditional note-taking systems which use a top-down approach to note-taking. For example, you'd first create a folder called "Math 101", and you'd put all your math notes in that folder. Obsidian uses a bottom-up approach to organization. While you can still create folders and place notes in them, Obsidian also allows you to make notes on the fly, and organize them later. For example, you can create as many math notes as you want, add a #Math_101 tag to it, and all your math notes can be found through this tag.</p>

    This is useful primarily because you often don't know what the note structure looks like in the beginning. The ideal structure of a note system often shows up ony after you write a few notes. This is why an emergent, evolving and bottom-up file structure like Obsidian is useful.

    Linked Thinking

    Since Obsidian treats each file as a node, you can treat each note as an entity. This is similar to how the internet is structure. For example, if you were to search for "Los Angeles" in Google, it returns the "Los Angeles" entity, including attributes like the country, the state, etc. The suggested searches might be the country (U.S.) or state (California) that it's in. These are two additional entities that the user can go to. As you zoom out, you can see how the internet is composed of a series of nodes/entities linked to each other.

    Using this approach to note-taking, I might be watching the movie "Delicatessen". I create a new note for this entity, such as my review on it, the plot, etc. However, I might realize that I wanted to take notes about the director, 'Jean Pierre Jeunet". I can not only create another entity for the director, but also link the movie to the director. Over time, I might have multiple movies directed by him, each as a separate note, pointing to him.

    The benefit of linked notes is that you are more likely to rediscover past notes. You might look into one note, and explore a chain of notes that are linked to it. In other words, linking makes your notes more useful because rediscovery of older notes are more likely.

    Here's an example of what all my notes look like in a large graph.

    Movies

    Here's a list of my favorite, must-watch movies!

    Paris, Texas
    Directed by Wim Wenders

    Whenever I get tired of the typical blockbuster movie, I often try to look for movies with a deeper, slower burn. With it's ambient pacing and gentle visuals, Paris, Texas is one of the best movies in this category. It tells a story about a father and son that starts off mysterious, and builds up to a highly engrossing conclusion. The film also looks gorgeous. I liken it to a more elegant version of Euphoria's visuals. Like Euphoria's filmic look and sumptuous lighting, Paris, Texas goes even further with subtler, gentler light sources. If you've ever looked around and appreciated the soft glow from a desk lamp, or the warm, calming kitchen lights at night, Paris, Texas does this in spades.
