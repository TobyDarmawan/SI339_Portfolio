                <p>
                    The things you can do in the real world is virtually infinite. One decision creates a ripple effect,
                    and
                    can
                    shape
                    the future trajectory of your life. This is really difficult to do in a game. A video game is
                    hard-coded; it
                    boils
                    down to lines of code, and having the ever-expanding set of possibilities found in the real world is
                    almost
                    a
                    pipe-dream. A genre that comes close is the immersive sim.

                <p>
                    One key feature of immersive sims is emergent gameplay,
                    made possible by the very robust system logic implemented by the developers. Emergent gameplay
                    occurs
                    when
                    players
                    perform many simple actions that, when executed together, can lead to uniquely complex outcomes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Many of these outcomes are unique to the player, rarely replicated by others, and many are never
                    anticipated
                    by
                    the developers themselves. In Dishonored, some of the possible moves are to slow down time, throw
                    bottles at
                    enemies, and attaching explosives to surfaces. While these three actions are very simple, the
                    systemic
                    nature of
                    the game allows combining them to create interesting outcomes. A player can throw a bottle to an
                    enemy,
                    stop
                    time
                    just before it hits them, attach the explosive to the bottle, run away, and resume time to eliminate
                    this
                    enemy
                    with the explosive bottle. If you've ever wanted to simulate being a real assassin, using the rules
                    of
                    this
                    game
                    world to your advantage, this game's the one.

                <h2>Elden Ring by FromSoftware</h2>

                <p>When you come across a beautiful piece of media, it can often feel too good to be true. When I
                    watched
                    Everything
                    Everywhere All at Once, I never wanted to end. Unfortunately, everything comes to an end. Then I
                    played
                    Elden
                    Ring. I marvelled at the beauty of the open vistas, the haunting glow of a distant castle. I never
                    wanted it
                    to
                    end. With a runtime of nearly 100 hours, I can rest easy knowing that I can return to this place for
                    the
                    weeks to
                    come.</p>
                <p>
                    Another mind-boggling realization I had about the game was of its many secrets. With every stretch
                    of
                    land
                    you
                    explore, there's likely a hidden dungeon just off the cliff. In every rooftop, there's likely
                    another
                    path
                    below
                    the ledge.</p>

                <img id="elden_img_3" src="src/elden_3.jpeg" alt="Elden ring's altus plateau." />
                <p>The fact that the developers managed to build a world this expansive, with each corner of
                    the
                    world so
                    dense with activity, is nothing short of a human feat. </p>

                <h2>Gris by Nomada Studio</h2>
                <p>
                    This is a much more accessible mobile game. It's a gorgeous platformer about a mother and daughter.

                <p>The
                    backgrounds are all hand-illustrated watercolor paintings, and each level comes alive with a
                    different theme and
                    color palette.</p>
                <p>Pair this with one of the best soundtracks in gaming, playing Gris feels like a
                    calming and meditative journey of loss and acceptance. </p>
