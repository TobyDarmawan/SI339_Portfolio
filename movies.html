    <h1>Movies</h1>

    <p>Here's a list of my favorite, must-watch movies!</p>

    <h2>Paris, Texas Directed by Wim Wenders</h2>

    <p>
      Whenever I get tired of the typical blockbuster movie, I often try to look for movies with a deeper, slower
      burn.
      With it's ambient pacing and gentle visuals, Paris, Texas is one of the best movies in this category. It
      tells a
      story about a father and son that starts off mysterious, and builds up to a highly engrossing conclusion.
      The film
      also looks gorgeous. I liken it to a more elegant version of Euphoria's visuals. Like Euphoria's filmic look
      and
      sumptuous lighting, Paris, Texas goes even further with subtler, gentler light sources. If you've ever
      looked
      around and appreciated the soft glow from a desk lamp, or the warm, calming kitchen lights at night, Paris,
      Texas
      does this in spades.

    <h2>Playtime Directed by Jacques Tati</h2>

    <p>
      The easiest way to describe Jacques Tati's later films would be that it's like the predecessor of Wes
      Anderson. If
      you've seen Wes Anderson's playful direction, like the one in French Dispatch or The Grande Budapest Hotel,
      Jacques Tati achieves much of the same in the late 60s. When watching Playtime, you'll wonder how the
      futuristic
      setting was built without any VFX. The movie is filled with subtle moments of visual comedy. Each
      re-watching can
      reveal a nifty detail you've never seen before. This movie feels like an orderly yet strange fever dream.

    <h2>Nathan For You Directed by Nathan Fielder</h2>

    <p>Imagine an incredibly awkward, introverted person. For such a person, navigating the world requires a set of
      pre-determined rules, and interacting with others requires mapping out the ideal outcome beforehand. I like
      to
      think of Nathan Fielder as that kind of person. He treats the world around him as the stage for his own
      play.
      Being the real world though, random events occur, and the script buckles under this non-deterministic
      setting.
      Despite these challenges, what makes Nathan for You one of the most intelligent TV shows is how Nathan
      manages to
      thrive within this chaos. When the reality show doesn't go to plan, he somehow makes these twists and turns
      make
      the show better. Think of wholesome plot twists, or unexpectedly happy endings. At the end of the day,
      watching
      this show feels like watching a play filled with real people, and real consequences. Yet somehow, you walk
      away
      from the play feeling very entertained, amused, and happy.</p>
