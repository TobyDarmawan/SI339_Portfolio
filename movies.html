    <h1>Movies</h1>

    <p>Here's a list of my favorite, must-watch movies!</p>

    <div class="movie">
      <h2>Paris, Texas Directed by Wim Wenders</h2>
      <p>
        Whenever I get tired of the typical blockbuster movie, I often try to look for movies with a deeper, slower
        burn.
        With it's ambient pacing and gentle visuals, Paris, Texas is one of the best movies in this category. It
        tells a
        story about a father and son that starts off mysterious, and builds up to a highly engrossing conclusion.
        The film
        also looks gorgeous. I liken it to a more elegant version of Euphoria's visuals. Like Euphoria's filmic look
        and
        sumptuous lighting, Paris, Texas goes even further with subtler, gentler light sources. If you've ever
        looked
        around and appreciated the soft glow from a desk lamp, or the warm, calming kitchen lights at night, Paris,
        Texas
        does this in spades.

      <h2>Playtime Directed by Jacques Tati</h2>

      <p>
        The easiest way to describe Jacques Tati's later films would be that it's like the predecessor of Wes
        Anderson. If
        you've seen Wes Anderson's playful direction, like the one in French Dispatch or The Grande Budapest Hotel,
        Jacques Tati achieves much of the same in the late 60s. When watching Playtime, you'll wonder how the
        futuristic
        setting was built without any VFX. The movie is filled with subtle moments of visual comedy. Each
        re-watching can
        reveal a nifty detail you've never seen before. This movie feels like an orderly yet strange fever dream.

      <h2>Nathan For You Directed by Nathan Fielder</h2>

      <p>Imagine an incredibly awkward, introverted person. For such a person, navigating the world requires a set of
        pre-determined rules, and interacting with others requires mapping out the ideal outcome beforehand. I like
        to
        think of Nathan Fielder as that kind of person. He treats the world around him as the stage for his own
        play.
        Being the real world though, random events occur, and the script buckles under this non-deterministic
        setting.
        Despite these challenges, what makes Nathan for You one of the most intelligent TV shows is how Nathan
        manages to
        thrive within this chaos. When the reality show doesn't go to plan, he somehow makes these twists and turns
        make
        the show better. Think of wholesome plot twists, or unexpectedly happy endings. At the end of the day,
        watching
        this show feels like watching a play filled with real people, and real consequences. Yet somehow, you walk
        away
        from the play feeling very entertained, amused, and happy.</p>
